    Mirroreum with ALA4R for geospatial data

## Topics

* Stack for geospatial analysis tasks
* <https://github.com/bioatlas/mirroreum>
* Automated Build at Docker Hub - rebuilds when GitHub repo changes
* <https://hub.docker.com/r/bioatlas/mirroreum>
* Deployed at bioatlas.se
* <https://mirroreum.bioatlas.se>

## Why use "mirroreum"?

* Why not use another web page?
  - Reproducible Open Research (other web pages can often not be scripted)
  - Work locally, off-line (rstudio.cloud doesn't work off-line)
  - Certain tasks like Niche Modelling happen naturally in an RStudio IDE
  - Dashboards or canned reports are different

## Example

* Explain [R config for ALA](.Rprofile)
* Use [example with Moose in Sweden](geospatial_example.R)

## Automated Build

The [Mirroreum repo](https://github.com/bioatlas/mirroreum) is a stack for geospatial analysis tasks available as a versioned [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/bioatlas/mirroreum) which rebuilds when the GitHub repo is updated through an [Automated Build](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/).

## Integration into ala-docker

Mirroreum is integrated into ala-docker or elsewhere where docker and docker-compose runs:

* <https://github.com/bioatlas/ala-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L262-L270>

Account management in Mirroreum is based on Linux/Unix user accounts and users and home folders are created and managed like on Unix systems.

Since this is a Docker container, it can be pulled and run locally and independently, even in an off-line scenario.
